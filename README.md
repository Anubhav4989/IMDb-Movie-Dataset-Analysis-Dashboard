## Project Summary
### Introduction
This presentation provides a summary of insights extracted from the IMDb Movie Dataset, visualized using Power BI. The dashboard showcases various metrics and trends related to IMDb movies, including ratings, genres, and more.

### Key Insights

#### Ratings Distribution
- The majority of movies on IMDb have ratings between 6.0 and 8.0.
- Movies with higher ratings (above 8.5) represent a smaller proportion, often including critically acclaimed titles.
- The ratings distribution follows a bell curve, with fewer movies receiving extreme ratings (either very low or very high).

#### Genre Popularity
- Action and Drama genres dominate the IMDb movie database.
- Genres like Sci-Fi and Fantasy also feature prominently, often aligned with popular franchises.
- Niche genres (e.g., Documentary, Musical) make up a smaller portion but show steady popularity among specific audiences.

#### Box Office and Ratings Correlation
- There is a moderate positive correlation between higher IMDb ratings and box office success.
- However, certain movies with average ratings have achieved significant box office revenue, suggesting the impact of marketing and franchise power.
